        <p>
  As a reporter for Nevada Central Media, I covered stories centered on local communities, culture, and human-interest narratives across Nevada. I conducted on-site interviews, researched community issues, and developed feature articles that amplified underrepresented voices and highlighted meaningful local stories. From pitch to publication, I was involved in the full reporting process—story development, interviewing, writing, and revision—ensuring accuracy, clarity, and strong storytelling. This experience strengthened my journalistic instincts, sharpened my writing and interviewing skills, and reinforced my commitment to ethical, community-focused reporting.
