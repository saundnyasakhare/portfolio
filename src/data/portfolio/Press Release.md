        <p>As a Graduate Assistant for Nevada Conservatory Theatre at UNLV's Department of Theatre, I served as the primary public relations liaison for the conservatory's theatrical productions. I crafted and distributed press releases for every show in the season, managing media outreach to promote performances to local Las Vegas audiences and arts communities. This role required translating artistic vision into compelling public-facing narratives, coordinating with directors and production teams to capture the essence of each production, and maintaining relationships with local media. Through strategic communication and timely press materials, I helped drive audience engagement and visibility for the Nevada Conservatory Theatre's diverse slate of theatrical performances.</p>
