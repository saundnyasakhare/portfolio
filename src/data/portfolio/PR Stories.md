        <p>I developed a strategic public relations campaign for Bring It Back, a Las Vegas sneaker resale store with three locations and 150,000+ Instagram followers. Through stakeholder interviews, customer surveys, and market analysis, I identified an opportunity to leverage storytelling to differentiate the brand in a competitive market. I created a multi-platform strategy centered on authentic narratives—including founder stories, customer testimonials, and a 'Your Sneaker Story' social media campaign—to position Bring It Back as the cultural heart of Las Vegas sneaker culture. The campaign emphasized their unique buy-sell-trade model and commitment to community inclusivity, with goals including 15% social media engagement growth, 10% website traffic increase, and collection of customer stories through user-generated content.</p>
